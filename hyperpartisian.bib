abstract = {Raw datasets collected for fake news detection usually contain some noise such as missing values. In order to improve the performance of machine learning based fake news detection, a novel data preprocessing method is proposed in this paper to process the missing values. Specifically, we have successfully handled the missing values problem by using data imputation for both categorical and numerical features. For categorical features, we imputed missing values with the most frequent value in the columns. For numerical features, the mean value of the column is used to impute numerical missing values. In addition, TF-IDF vectorization is applied in feature extraction to filter out irrelevant features. Experimental results show that Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier with the proposed data preprocessing method outperforms baselines and improves the prediction accuracy by more than 15{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

@article{Verma2017426,
abstract = {What factors influence trust in online information? Americans increasingly get information from social media, public distrust in the mainstream media is growing and “fake news” is an important new phenomenon. This paper examines the factors that influence trust in scientific claims posted via social media, including the use of hyperlinks and readers' values. The paper describes a crowdsourcing-based experimental design using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. The core of the experiment was a set of 10 scientific findings reported in open-access, peer-reviewed scientific journals, which were in turn linked to in articles in both the mainstream media and “fake news” sites. Data analysis involved exploration of relationships between trust and the presence or absence of hyperlinks, and between trust and human values using nonparametric statistical methods. In terms of the influence of hyperlinks on trust, inclusion of hyperlinks to scientific journals, mainstream media articles, and even hidden URLs led to higher trust than hyperlinks to “fake news” sites or posts without hyperlinks (p {\textless} 0.001). Participants who clicked on hyperlinks to scientific articles placed higher trust in the claims than those who did not (p {\textless} 0.001). In terms of the influence of values on trust, values had the most impact in cases where individuals saw, but decided not to click on, hyperlinks; this finding seems to indicate that in the absence of firsthand examination of the hyperlinked sites, participants tend to rely more heavily on their values to determine their trust in a scientific claim. These findings indicate that both the presence and absence of hyperlinks and the values of the reader both significantly impact trust judgments. {\textcopyright} 2017 Nitin Verma, Kenneth R.

Today, the fact retrieval system is one of the most effective tools for identifying the information for decision-making. We propose the approach based on factual information systematization. Different interpretations of the same phenomenon, as well as the inconsistency, inaccuracy or mismatch in information coming from different sources, lead to the task of factual information extraction. In this work, we explore how can natural language processing methods help to check contradictions and mismatches in facts automatically. The reference model of the fact-based analytical system is proposed. It consists of such basic components as Document Search component, Fact retrieval component, Fact Analysis component, Visualization component, and Control component. {\textcopyright} 2018 CEUR-WS.

Our model draws on advances in representation learning in natural language processing and network science to capture cues from both textual content and the network structure of news articles. We empirically evaluate our model against a battery of baselines and show that our model outperforms state of the art by 10 percentage points F1 score.},

abstract = {Fake news on social media is a major challenge and studies have shown that fake news can propagate exponentially quickly in early stages. Therefore, we focus on early detection of fake news, and consider that only news article text is available at the time of detection, since additional information such as user responses and propagation patterns can be obtained only after the news spreads. However, we find historical user responses to previous articles are available and can be treated as soft semantic labels, that enrich the binary label of an article, by providing insights into why the article must be labeled as fake. We propose a novel Two-Level Convolutional Neural Network with User Response Generator (TCNN-URG) where TCNN captures semantic information from article text by representing it at the sentence and word level, and URG learns a generative model of user response to article text from historical user responses which it can use to generate responses to new articles in order to assist fake news detection. We conduct experiments on one available dataset and a larger dataset collected by ourselves. Experimental results show that TCNN-URG outperforms the baselines based on prior approaches that detect fake news from article text alone. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Receiving information from Facebook and generating or spreading information on Facebook every day has become a general lifestyle. This new information-exchanging platform contains a lot of meaningful messages including users' emotions and preferences. Using messages on Facebook or in general social media to predict the election result and political affiliation has been a trend. In Taiwan, for example, almost every politician tries to have public opinion polls by using social media; almost every politician has his or her own fan page on Facebook, and so do the parties. We make an effort to predict to what party, DPP or KMT, two major parties in Taiwan, a post would be related or affiliated. We design features and models for the prediction, and we evaluate as well as compare them with the data collected from several political fan pages on Facebook. The results show that we can obtain accuracy higher than 90{\%} when the text and interaction features are used with a nearest neighbor classifier. {\textcopyright} 2017 ACM.},

abstract = {In this article, we uncover a network of Twitterbots comprising 13,493 accounts that tweeted the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, only to disappear from Twitter shortly after the ballot. We compare active users to this set of political bots with respect to temporal tweeting behavior, the size and speed of retweet cascades, and the composition of their retweet cascades (user-to-bot vs. bot-to-bot) to evidence strategies for bot deployment. Our results move forward the analysis of political bots by showing that Twitterbots can be effective at rapidly generating small- to medium-sized cascades; that the retweeted content comprises user-generated hyperpartisan news, which is not strictly fake news, but whose shelf life is remarkably short; and, finally, that a botnet may be organized in specialized tiers or clusters dedicated to replicating either active users or content generated by other bots. {\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract = {As the number and the diversity of news outlets on the Web grows, so does the opportunity for "alternative" sources of information to emerge. Using large social networks like Twitter and Facebook, misleading, false, or agenda-driven information can quickly and seamlessly spread online, deceiving people or influencing their opinions. Also, the increased engagement of tightly knit communities, such as Reddit and 4chan, further compounds the problem, as their users initiate and propagate alternative information, not only within their own communities, but also to different ones as well as various social media. In fact, these platforms have become an important piece of the modern information ecosystem, which, thus far, has not been studied as a whole. In this paper, we begin to fill this gap by studying mainstream and alternative news shared on Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan. By analyzing millions of posts around several axes, we measure how mainstream and alternative news flows between these platforms. Our results indicate that alt-right communities within 4chan and Reddit can have a surprising level of influence on Twitter, providing evidence that "fringe" communities often succeed in spreading alternative news to mainstream social networks and the greater Web. {\textcopyright} 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

@article{David2016610,
abstract = {Purpose-Social network sites have been widely adopted by politicians in the last election campaigns. To increase the effectiveness of these campaigns the potential electorate is to be identified, as targeted ads are much more effective than non-targeted ads. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose and implement a new methodology for automatic prediction of political orientation of users on social network sites by comparison to texts from the overtly political parties' pages. Design/methodology/approach-To this end, textual information on personal users' pages is used as a source of statistical features. The authors apply automatic text categorization algorithms to distinguish between texts of users from different political wings. However, these algorithms require a set of manually labeled texts for training, which is typically unavailable in real life situations. To overcome this limitation the authors propose to use texts available on various political parties' pages on a social network site to train the classifier. The political leaning of these texts is determined by the political affiliation of the corresponding parties. The classifier learned on such overtly political texts is then applied on the personal user pages to predict their political orientation. To assess the validity and effectiveness of the proposed methodology two corpora were constructed: personal Facebook pages of 450 Israeli citizens, and political parties Facebook pages of the nine prominent Israeli parties. Findings-The authors found that when a political tendency classifier is trained and tested on data in the same corpus, accuracy is very high. More significantly, training on manifestly political texts (political party Facebook pages) yields classifiers which can be used to classify non-political personal Facebook pages with fair accuracy. Social implications-Previous studies have shown that targeted ads are more effective than non-targeted ads leading to substantial saving in the advertising budget. Therefore, the approach for automatic determining the political orientation of users on social network sites might be adopted for targeting political messages, especially during election campaigns. Originality/value-This paper proposes and implements a new approach for automatic cross-corpora identification of political bias of user profiles on social network. This suggests that individuals' political tendencies can be identified without recourse to any tagged personal data. In addition, the authors use learned classifiers to determine which self-identified centrists lean left or right and which voters are likely to switch allegiance in subsequent elections. {\textcopyright} 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Political blogs as a form of social media allow for an uniquely interactive form of political discourse. This is especially evident in focused blogs with a strong ideological identity. We investigate techniques to identify topics within the context of the community, which when discussed in a blog post evoke a discernible positive or negative collective opinion from readers who respond to posts in comments. This is done by using computational methods to assign sentiment polarity to blog comments and learning community specific models that summarize issues tackled by blogs and predict the polarity based on the topics discussed in a blog post.},
